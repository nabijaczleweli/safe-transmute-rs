//! Transmutation of trivial objects
//!
//! Functions in this module are guarded from out-of-bounds memory access and
//! from unsafe transmutation target types through the use of the
//! [`TriviallyTransmutable`](trait.TriviallyTransmutable.html)) trait.
//!
//! If a certain type can be safely constructed out of any byte combination,
//! then it may implement this trait. This is the case for primitive integer
//! types (e.g. `i32`, `u32`, `i64`), arrays of other trivially transmutable
//! types, and `repr(C)` structs composed of trivially transmutable values.
//!
//! However, they are still not entirely safe because the source data may not
//! be correctly aligned for reading and writing a value of the target type.
//! The effects of this range from less performance (e.g. x86) to trapping or
//! address flooring (e.g. ARM), but this is undefined behavior nonetheless.

/// A type `T` implementing this trait means that any arbitrary slice of bytes
/// of length `size_of::<T>()` can be safely interpreted as a value of that
/// type with support for unaligned memory access. In most (but not all)
/// cases this is a [*POD class*](http://eel.is/c++draft/class#10) or a
/// [*trivially copyable class*](http://eel.is/c++draft/class#6).
///
/// This serves as a marker trait for all functions in this module.
///
/// *Warning*: if you transmute into a floating-point type you will have a chance to create a signaling NaN,
/// which, while not illegal, can be unwieldy. Check out [`util::designalise_f{32,64}()`](util/index.html)
/// for a remedy.
///
/// *Nota bene*: `bool` is not `TriviallyTransmutable` because they're restricted to
/// being `0` or `1`, which means that an additional value check is required.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// It is only safe to implement `TriviallyTransmutable` for a type `T` if it
/// is safe to read or write a value `T` at the pointer of an arbitrary slice
/// `&[u8]`, of length `size_of<T>()`, as long as the same slice is
/// *well aligned* in memory for reading and writing a `T`.
